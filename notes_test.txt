EmailTopicsDrilldown:We cannot filter it out in Email Topics UI.
EmailTopicsDrilldown:"TopTopics Sprint "Stories
TopTopicsSprintStories: Q/A Reports:
TopTopicsSprintStories:: Automated Summary Top Topics reports for 5 users - to be run and committed every change
TopTopicsSprintStories: Languages ? English specific tokenizer, freq-words, black-list similarity patterns, signature detection, per patterns
TopTopicsSprintStories: Advance Ranking, Similarity, NLP Terms, NER (PER,LOC) and Noise Reduction
TopTopicsSprintStories: Assist the user in comprehension of displayed Topics (e.g. 'Display Topic Context', 'Group Co-occurring Topics'). Help building user trust in the product.
TopTopicsSprintStories: Note: Their count is not the same, because one of the instances is preceded by 'Setup':
TopTopicsSprintStories: all appear in same updates, and only in these updates
TopTopicsSprintStories: Problem: Even if we eliminate subject duplication, we still have to rank high topics in subject, in a long thread with several from:ram
TopTopicsSprintStories: Freeup slots in 5 top-topics
TopTopicsSprintStories: Note: Related to 'Group Co-occurring Topics' above, but extend it to cases where context is non-topic (not a Term).
TopTopicsSprintStories: Remove from Top Topics
TopTopicsSprintStories: Motivation: Easier for a user to manage 5-10 Top-Topics that are well known.
TopTopicsSprintStories: Add icon (X) to Top Topic UI
TopTopicsSprintStories: Ignore Topic - even in drilldown and other views.
TopTopicsSprintStories: They DO share some factors with isMarketingEmail
TopTopicsSprintStories: Add To Top Topics
TopTopicsSprintStories: attributes.userSelections.lastSelectionDate
TopTopicsSprintStories: Why: my friend ignored the Topic but I didn't
TopTopicsSprintStories: Workaround: D:\views\Collage\tools\collage-graph\neo4j-queries\affinity\affinity.json
TopTopicsSprintStories: Neighbrhood / Context / PageRank - Good Topics appear together  (1-2 months)
TopTopicsSprintStories: Problem: 'Register', 'Reminder', 'Webinar', 'Agenda' and other non-Topics (that better Google PROPN should filterout) --> may get a boost.
TopTopicsSprintStories: Map a single collageUserId to multiple emails
TopTopicsSprintStories: Used in ranking .fromMe
TopTopicsSprintStories: Subject duplicate Terms count: When counting the terms per update (not conversation) --> count the subject terms for each update (artifact) even it is duplicated in the conversation.
TopTopicsSprintStories: General Blacklist (all Orgs) - maintain old Collage BlackList (Thanx, LOL - frequent Urban dict / Slang words)
TopTopicsSprintStories: SharePoint influencers (PROPN+NOUN)--> will add to counts of SharePoint Influencers (PROPN+PROPN)
TopTopicsSprintStories: 'Enterprise          2             1' - filter out non-terms (propn followed by numbers but with tabs/spaces which are part of table columns - not 'MS Build 2018')
TopTopicsSprintStories: Dictionary / Structured - 'Gazetteer'
TopTopicsSprintStories: High Quality Structured - if from SP Metadata value (TermSet, Keyword)
TopTopicsSprintStories: SharePoint Search for dictionary Topics (+ possible Short forms) to extract Topics from SP documents
TopTopicsSprintStories: Reasons:
TopTopicsSprintStories: Update regulary
TopTopicsSprintStories: Similarity (3 months)
Q/AReport-TopTopics: Goals:

Q/AReport-TopTopics: Easy to execute (cmdline/CI)
Q/AReport-TopTopics: Expected top-topic Yes/No --> Per user, date-range
Q/AReport-TopTopics: Mark Topics (by users, per date-range) as top-topic, topic, non-topic --> rank changes measure considers if a good (top-topic) is moved down, non-topic up
Q/AReport-TopTopics: Mark each report with commit message of what has changed --> link it to git (sha1/hyperlink to commit of relevant repo)
Q/AReport-TopTopics: Delete this temp report and after commit, CI will run the official report with sha1 of all repos (github/vsts)

Q/AReport-TopTopics: Individual Algo output
Q/AReport-TopTopics:Bug: All jArt saved in details (with their factors) - Today sig,per filters out
Q/AReport-TopTopics:A: Store Algo output in topic.factors.dup.details = <array of logs> --> refactor factors.dup.value
Q/AReport-TopTopics: Factors filters checkboxes - they present a subset of the detailed emails - only those with the checked factors (have to fix below bug to enable that).
Q/AReport-TopTopics: Scenario: Major Algo commit (Ex: report:Fixed duplicate between subjects) --> Summary report with latest /report:/ commit comment
Q/AReport-TopTopics: If dev suspects a regression --> Summary Diff to LKG --> all Code changes are displayed (see below)

LanguageModel:--------------------------
LanguageModel:A: Doens't help, since even if total is 3-4, usually common english words will be mostly allLower --> later, if 3-4 resulted in a mistake, it will be fixed once more stats are gathered.
LanguageModel: Q/A: expectedTopicsTest Compare --> Why diff from
LanguageModel: Q/A: referenceCount in MongoStorage
LanguageModel: Suspected async / concurrent access to lmConversations -->

LanguageModel: How to garbageCollectLowStatsFromDb in incremental ?
LanguageModel: Remove Reports\langModel.js after all tests completed
LanguageModel: Today, we slide a window of 1,2,3 ngrams and store stats in Mongo.
LanguageModel:
LanguageModel: Online: Incremental Update of LangModel:
LanguageModel: Pipeline of a single Update: Url-Preprocessing ? --> Terms-Processing --> single word grams --> LangModel batch-update Redis-Lua (below)
LanguageModel: Today: Store in-mem-dict for detecting duplicate  (easy because langModel is incremenetal Offline)
LanguageModel: Before processing an update --> lookup cur ConversationId in Db --> If exist --> ignore Subject
LanguageModel: If exist --> words from Subj were already processed by another worker (seen an update from same ConversationId)
LanguageModel: Impl: Problem: Atomicy (Multiple LM workers).
LanguageModel: Offline:
LanguageModel: Impl: nodeJS that wakes up every hour ? cronjob ?
LanguageModel: Ex: gName: 'alert' is not lmBadTopic --> *ALERT* , Alert is common in subject
LanguageModel: More Good Topics (Ram, Old Mongo Reports)
LanguageModel: How to disqualify bi-grams ? (Currently only disqualify unigrams)
LanguageModel: Possible Maybe ATE/ATR methods see 'Terms Processing' and not simple langModel are more suited ?
LanguageModel: How can we disqualify 'online meetings' ? It is the same meaning in both lower and upper.
LanguageModel: Google NGram Viewer doesn't show any differences. 'proxy configuration' is of low freq compared to others   https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Management+Buyout%2Cmanagement+buyout%2CDaily+Report%2CDaily+report%2Cdaily+report%2Cweb+page%2CWeb+Page%2CProxy+Configuration%2CUser+Name%2Cuser+name%2COnline+Meetings%2Conline+meetings&year_start=1800&year_end=2003&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CManagement%20Buyout%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cmanagement%20buyout%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CDaily%20Report%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CDaily%20report%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cdaily%20report%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cweb%20page%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CWeb%20Page%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CProxy%20Configuration%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CUser%20Name%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cuser%20name%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2COnline%20Meetings%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Conline%20meetings%3B%2Cc0
LanguageModel: Do not not disqualify bi-grams without additional evidence (higher threshold, isFreq bi-gram, in external-Dict-Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_buyout) ?
LanguageModel: startsUpperFirstInSentence - shouldn't be in subject (because it is not really a sentence and may be a title: 'Management Buyout')
LanguageModel: Count lowers as Topics:
LanguageModel: Co-occur upper-lower: If we see 'Management Buyout' near (same email) 'management buyout' - they are probably the same. Especially since they are not freq-bi-gram the email is not very long
LanguageModel:  Sub Compound for lowerCase - 39 of the 228 lowee are 'on board' --> we need to remove them. 'board meetings', 'board of director of harmon.ie'--> will
LanguageModel: A: They appear together 6 times. 'Management Board' appears inside a URL ! https://harmonie.sharepoint.com/finance/Management%20Board/Q1%202018/Board/harmon.ie%20Board%20Agenda%20April%202018.doc
LanguageModel:: 'Teams' 'Story' - Sub-Topic skews counts: When Unigram (Story) occurs inside a compound phrase
LanguageModel: afterMidUpperSU: Count startsUpper after a word that is also SU, but not first in sentence --> meaning inside a compound phrase
LanguageModel: Note: Only if initial results are encouraging
LanguageModel:: Q: Filter out isMarketingEmail for LM ?
LanguageModel: The language model will reflect better the manually-written Org language style. Marketing emails tends to add Capitalized Phrases ...
LanguageModel: Ex: General - general:{score:-1,stats:{_id:5ae8644ef876990c7cd93fb8,gName:general,allLower:63,startsUpper:207,startsUpperFirstInSentence:61,afterPosSU:11,afterAnSU:0,afterNumSU:1}}
LanguageModel: Has startsUpper >> allLower
LanguageModel: General Inquiries: 647-258-3800 (from salesforce marketing email)
LanguageModel: General Data Protection Regulation
LanguageModel: Save every normalized subject processed and do not process new subject if already processed.
LanguageModel: helpers.getNormalizedSubject(subj)
LanguageModel:duplicates (Ex: Google)
LanguageModel: In General, it seems LM helps mostly with common uni-grams disqualify BadTopics which are also commonly used in emails
LanguageModel: Dictionary Fix common-words which are Topics in harmon.ie (Build, Word)
LanguageModel: afterMidUpperSU (temp disabled) Compound Sub Phrase:  Filter  Unigram (Story/Teams) occurs inside a compound phrase 	(User Story, Microsoft Teams)
LanguageModel: Problem: It reduces the upperCount (- afterMidUpperSU), but doesn't have a balancing formula to reduce also lowerCount (e.g on board) + reduce lower board used as same Topic as upper 'Board'
LanguageModel:incorrect: 56 --> 52,
LanguageModel: lowStats (total < 6 ): Many are ORG with all occurrences in upper.
LanguageModel: Ex: xenmobile, xenapp, xenserver - were only in isFocused : false mails.
LanguageModel: Possible Explanation: While Email marketing changes counts, they use a similar terms to the ones we use - that is why we registered for them --> LM is not changed by much.
LanguageModel: Added isFreqWord -
LanguageModel: Bad Topics which LM thinks a good + Why it thinks Good.
LanguageModel: intelligence - Part of Compound Topic - isMarketingEmail, Dups ?
LanguageModel: Ex: Word, Excel or PDF documents -->
LanguageModel: cheers - signature removal.

LanguageModel: isFocused
LanguageModel:Q/A: Fix: nlp report is broken
LanguageModel: langModel.js: If LM --> try repro with  (maybe without much memory flag)
LanguageModel: reduce update rec chunk size - so we can compare duration Ms. Does it matter ?
LanguageModel: New tokens are not saved - when their content change (ex: NER changes from O to PERSON), but their number and text doesn't
LanguageModel: Problem: Old bug: shallow arrayDiff

Signatures: Restrict Skype (can be mentioned outside sig when coordinating a call)
Signatures:: Filter out blacklist: mailto
Signatures: case-insensitive (--jean) - but do not trust it (only if properly supported by following lines)
Signatures: Use from.displayName (easier than emailAddress) --> If a short line contains at least one of the words in displayName, plus it is close to end of line, plus it is at
Signatures: Filter out
Signatures: If some of the words that matches parts of email address domain @us.ibm.com --> ignore these words:
Signatures: from.emailAddress - take left to @ + processes similar to displayName ?

Business/UserScenarios: Librarian - Admin Dictionary
Business/UserScenarios:----------------------------------------
Business/UserScenarios: Study Ranking evaluation formulas and adapt them to our needs (non-topic, top-10 ...)
Business/UserScenarios: Why these topics (1 month from graph without isTopic / ignored filter) do not appear for Ram in mongo
Business/UserScenarios: Combine Author-Topic score boost after Top-Topics aggregate
Business/UserScenarios:a) Sent by cur-user
Business/UserScenarios: Workaround: Find simple email (possibly with a reply) that was sent by cur-user and is associated with the topic
Business/UserScenarios: Meaning: The terms contained in body are by cur-user (Topic Author)
Business/UserScenarios: No Reply Text: Even in updates of the replier (Kobi), the body is the original body (only the text dekel wrote)
Business/UserScenarios: Workaround: Allow more time (2-4 Months).
Business/UserScenarios: Problem: Some Junk Topics were replied (Close-Won: 'Job', 'SOHO', 'Opportunity Link' ...)
Business/UserScenarios: Only boost score of updates that were replied to and actually contribute  1 --> 1.5 to updateCount to a Topic in last 7 days.
Business/UserScenarios: Ex: Yaacov recieved 3 emails (To, CC) about Euclid, but didn't write it himself but did reply to it.
Business/UserScenarios: Duplicate Texts - Ram: 'Office 365' and 'URL' - Support Request, 'Username' - Order fulfillment emails,   - see 'Duplicate
Business/UserScenarios: Can we use hashes / word-shapes in a window around the term ? Privacy + Small space overhead per term in an update
Business/UserScenarios:A: Improved somewhat (because we already manually removed reply-to emails manually )
Business/UserScenarios: Query Impl: discount updates with Senders which are:
Business/UserScenarios: Or From length >= 5
Business/UserScenarios: TF-IDF / Count Too High : Investigate Remove Count > Cutoff ?
Business/UserScenarios: /used from msgraph
Business/UserScenarios: Emails Filed (in Outlook Folder or SP) - more important
Period:Goal: The report should present novel/informative/trending topics
Period: Metadata required: YC doesn't have folder structure, as davidl - he requires Metadata from SalesAccounts
Period: yc/used: Outlook occur alot in previewText
Period: Does office 365 (or which of its children) - really top topic for ramt mar-apr ?
Period: Only remove very General-Terms (sharepoint? office? - but not outlook)
Period: Use Affinity on last several Months.
Period: POC: Tested on all users - mostly david, yc, ramt, some noaml - a gross approximation of an affinity ... (~10000 emails)
Period: See D:\views\Collage.Topics\Reports\nlp\output\affinity_4_users_4_month_10000_emails.txt
Period: 'office365' rank: 36.07 count: 161 factors: { fromMe: 4 sig: 10 dup: 12 automated: 22 autoEmail: 7 reFilt: 17 childRank: 104.4 childCount: 91 general: true}

Period: Nested in other terms:
Period: Problem: 'Board' --> 'Management Board', 'Advisory Board'
Period:4) Semantic Relatedness: A term is more general if it is semantically related to many specific terms.
Period: Note: We can use word2vec or other measures - similar to SemRe-Rank (that also uses baseline extractor and then word2vec measure Semantic Relatedness)
Period: Graph based methods - If a Term is Semantic Related (Co-occur, Distibutional, word2vec) to many other Terms --> General Term

TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Remove File Extension (.docx, .7z)
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: readhttp:// concat with 1 word before url (if no space) --> we need to manualy
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Consider <Topic>: (Term ending with colon) --> low rank. Ex: Forms
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood:"Terms-LM
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Toofr | Want help getting appointments?
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Ex: * Arbitrary arguments
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Test for bullets *, pipes (|)
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: [Last Chance-Register Now] --> Last Chance is a badTopic that will occur only at sentenceStart once we make the change.
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Watson Workspace (Toscana Project) --> This is not a sentence start --> it is an NNP insideBrackets
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: See atr4s - they may have this kind of logic
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood:	Ex: 'Cloud computing' - NN
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Count in same Update / Same Conversation / Nearby Updates --> higher LM score
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Ex: Parent Topics: If mail contains 'Microsoft keynote' --> It may also contain 'Microsoft' --> which should have higher influence when calculating parent of 'Microsoft keynote'
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Compound number of tokens limit:
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: If parent Topic exist (len=5)--> add the new term (without the 6th token)
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: If we get 'sp'.childCount from Affinity --> 'SP' should separate from Catalyst and EY OWA.
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Q: Why childCount is so low (2 - 3 for all 3 management users) compared to other General Terms ?
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Rule 1 + Rule 2 will fix it.
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: prefixes-dict childRank contrib if parent.rank >= 7 (MIN_STANDALONE_RANK) and child.rank <  MIN_STANDALONE_RANK
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: If allow to contribute childRank to parent with rank 1,2 --> helps Catalyst and EY OWA, but also boost SP (prev top 50) --> topTopic
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Problem: General Terms were boosted SharePoint, LinkedIn) because they have a lot of children
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Limit childRank contribution to topics not in top10 (did help for SP)
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: General Terms --> penalize rank /= 3 if childCount >= 15 *** At report dateRange *** - not all.
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Q: Is Connections a parent or only a Syn ?
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Only add to Parent Topic counts from 2 Child Topic counts if:
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Rule 1 (Eyal): If the Child Topic doesn't cross standalone-Topic thresold --> fold its count under its Parent.
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Rule 2: Child Topic counts shouldn't help a Strong already Top-10 (e.g SharePoint) - Help only the weak
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood:  9 x 'SC agenda' + 5 x 'SC offer' -->  both standalone Topics --> so Rule 1 (Eyal) doesn't apply
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Parsing Fowrards / Qouted Emails
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Had to improve some of the statistical calc database updating code to do incremental updates
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood:--------------------------------------------------------
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood:Starts with Capitalized Adj JJ/JJR/JJS
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Some Good some Bad for TopTopics

TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood:: Aspiring category disruptors  Ctx:category disruptor or a category creator? Aspiring category disruptors are unlikely to succeed unless they
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: The author simply flatter Maven Clientsthe audience - the Topic still remains 'Maven Clients'
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Parent Topics Suffix --> childRank preserve rank of 'Maven Clients'
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Conc: Most insideBrackets seems to be useful for Acronyms
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Bug: Deleted: Taxonomy Boot Camp --> Added: Boot Camp (even Taxonomy Boot Camp is all NNP)

TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: Fix SharePoint influencers (below) + 'Migration to SharePoint'
TermsProcessingCompound-Unithood: CValue (1994): Only standalone occurences counts. If it appears nested as part of longer terms - substract them from all occurrences (remaining are standalone)

Performance/Scalability: Solution Online: Counter (Count Min Sketch) per user+date(day)+term + Per user Map of <Term,Counters>
Performance/Scalability: Lost 5 lower-case occurrences --> but Drilldown uses Search --> meaning it will still display them (we caa postprocess results of search to filter out)
Performance/Scalability: Terms-LM: Do we need Spark for online-update of Terms-LM langModel ?
Performance/Scalability: Few Spark instances for a short time period should be enough.
Performance/Scalability: Cache: - set of Terms already crossed threshold (say common threshold - not the highest for sentence start)
Performance/Scalability:5) When 'SP NA conf' finally crosses threshold --> async Job updates all updates that had this Term pending on decision if Topic
Performance/Scalability:7) G.C: Many terms will never come close to threshold (say occur 1 or 2 times). We do not want to store those in memory (10 million dead Terms)
Performance/Scalability:8) Conc: For Terms-LM: No need to rescan updates (emails) a second time with Spark - only update their Terms to Topics if threshold is crossed (above).
Performance/Scalability: Same Spark Job batch - we do have all data of all updates and instances
Performance/Scalability: Not duplicate ? --> rightNbr x 2
Performance/Scalability: Not duplicate ? --> leftNbrNL x2
Performance/Scalability: Try to calc leftNbrNL (maybe even leftNbr diff itself!) while iterating hunks of leftNbr diff ?

Difflicultcases: Note: Stanford and Google NLP thinks it is a PROPN
Difflicultcases:Tim@famapr.com - sometimes real emails and manual (not html) digest
Difflicultcases: Noise Topics (e.g File, Edit) - that we do not want to see (at least in our context)
Difflicultcases: Appears in 2 emails - Redmine notifications of the same Task (In Progress / Closed statuses)
Difflicultcases: We need the max number of matching-pos-tokens by a subset of occurrences (not all occur are duplicate) --> If this number is higher --> the subset size is smaller because less occurrences match a larger number of matching-pos-tokens.
Difflicultcases: Approximate Position within email (if always appears in the middle or beginning --> allow for smaller duplicate fingerprint --> still threshold it as duplicate)
Difflicultcases: A: There are alot of repeating 'View Pull Request' --> so we may not need Html for now
Difflicultcases: Citrix Ready -
Difflicultcases: Q: Why all emails except 1 are isFocus = false (David replied to this thread) --> isNonContributor = true
Difflicultcases: Investigate IsTerm : Wikipedia + freebase to boost Term score.
Difflicultcases: NLP Proper Noun (like today)
Difflicultcases: Up thershold from 2 to 10 (for words that do not appear in Wikipedia)
Difflicultcases:b) Rank contrib to Update
Difflicultcases:"Features Score "Factors
FeaturesScoreFactors:: Merge with other 'Features Score 'Factors
FeaturesScoreFactors: Importance of Conversation / Email / Sender - Convince/Pitch/Sell, Schedule meeting, Request, Commit, Task
FeaturesScoreFactors: Multiple Sources: SharePoint Recent Documents, SalesForce, Calendar
FeaturesScoreFactors: Ex: If only Jean is using 'Dll' (in multiple Email-Threads) --> shouldn't be a Topic
FeaturesScoreFactors: Ex: Neg: If wrote Cake is in the Kitchen (personal/hr related) or PER or LOC --> our filters should still remove it (so not every PROPN the user wrote is important)
FeaturesScoreFactors: Topic Click Session: After click - If user clicked one of the Drilldown results --> higher rank
FeaturesScoreFactors: Email Topics: If user selected an email from a 'Bad' sender --> dec Rank for Topics only from this Sender (ex: Support Technical Terms for Ron, while Customer names in support emails are important, because they are found in other good-Senders emails)
FeaturesScoreFactors: Importance of the Email/Calendar/Document/Folder-Name containing the Topic to the user:
FeaturesScoreFactors: ?? User in To/CC: If user is not in the To and not in CC (sent to mailing list - support@harmon.ie)  --> lower rank
FeaturesScoreFactors: Interaction with the Emails - What has the user done with the Email/Doc containing the Topic ?
FeaturesScoreFactors: Time to Respond/Whether Responded to Email containing the Topic
FeaturesScoreFactors: Open/Read a mail with the topic
FeaturesScoreFactors: Filed - more important
FeaturesScoreFactors: Problem: davidl deletes old emails (3 months old) - both less important and topTopics emails, which he knows he is done with --> no separator.
FeaturesScoreFactors: /used - specificity of Follow update-source: If follow a large Sales > Accounts --> It is less specific than Email to my Inbox
FeaturesScoreFactors: Slides are more carefully written and reviewed compared to Emails --> should contain important Topics (with correct spelling).
FeaturesScoreFactors: Dict (or certain Dict type) --> rank higher
FeaturesScoreFactors: Signature / Sent from 'OWA' on Android / Sent from 'Outlook' on Android--> lower
FeaturesScoreFactors: Other Collage orgs
FeaturesScoreFactors: Multi word title and every word is capitalized, (except prepositions, DET, conj, relative PROPN or neg), consider it an entity --> single word title --> require 65% occur in article text capitalized
FeaturesScoreFactors: See LinkProbability method
FeaturesScoreFactors: If page has hight pagerank --> higher score
FeaturesScoreFactors: If this ratio is low --> require more occurences
FeaturesScoreFactors: 'Terms Processing and Ranking 'Unithood' (Compound/Subsumption):
FeaturesScoreFactors: If a longer Keyphrase contains this Keyphrase --> lower (less specific). See 'Basic' - method to find average specificity terms (Ex: Microsoft Office)
FeaturesScoreFactors: PageRank/Personalized PageRank: (long documents) a candidate is important if it is related to (1) a large number of candidates and (2) candidates that are important.   (Per document, Per user..)
FeaturesScoreFactors: Word-Vector distance (see 'SemRe-Rank)
FeaturesScoreFactors: Ex: Email about a conference describing a list of subejcts: 'FW: Deadline April 23:  KMWorld November Events Call for Speakers' from:Gina@famapr.com
FeaturesScoreFactors: Reads/Has a lot of emails with this topic in the report period (but not so much topic-count in other periods, other users ...)
FeaturesScoreFactors: Compare to other periods (weeks)
FeaturesScoreFactors: Compare User + Closed 	 vs. The others ....
FeaturesScoreFactors: Latent Factors: SVD / LDA:
FeaturesScoreFactors:--------------------------------------------
FeaturesScoreFactors: Open my machine name under Cosmos in Azure - so unit-testing works
FeaturesScoreFactors: After code pushed to Alpha: plink map local port to alpha mongo. delete user tokens + refresh link
FeaturesScoreFactors: Problem: Yaacov Feedback - Only 2 were relevant. Many old
TFIDF: Report for counting/counting rank of every top topic every 2 weeks (like running many reports.js in 2 weeks intervals, for each user)
TFIDF: Output csv file --> Plot and analyze in Excel.
TFIDF: rspb - has high count in Mar, Jun, (not in  Jul), Aug
TFIDF: Problem: What is a high count ? Ram has fewer emails, so all his counts are lower
TFIDF:- - - - - -
TFIDF:Tools
EmailImportance: These classes serve as high-level features to predict Topic/Email importance.
EmailImportance:- - - - -
EmailImportance: Speech Acts and Dialog Acts
EmailImportance: Important Acts: Convince/Pitch/Sell (Internal and External Pitch), Schedule meeting, Request, Commit, Task (related also to the other acts)
EmailImportance: If some inside-sales sends me an email trying to sell me something (schedule a call with me) --> may not be so important to me (the report-user)
EmailImportance: Usage in email in https://medium.com/@paulomalvar/couriers-question-classifier-88c96c8a9a29
EmailImportance: Article with Datasets -
EmailImportance:Read: Gmail Priority Inbox - https://github.com/drewconway/ML-Email-Code/blob/master/04-Priority_Inbox/priority_inbox_learning.pdf
EmailImportance: On the other hand, shorter, less important emails containing less important Topics may be easier to reply immediately (ex: Did you sent the build to the customer ?)
EmailImportance:---------------------------------------------
EmailImportance: Entities (from Stanford tokens)- use PER and DateTime to abstract training samples (as LUIS does) - they appear frequently in Schedule sentences.
EmailImportance: What is enough context (sentence) that isn't too large (and contains irrelevant words)
EmailImportance: ML classifier should handle it.
EmailImportance:Train Dataset for Dialog Acts
TrainDatasetforDialogActs:Positive relationship sentences
TrainDatasetforDialogActs:Thanx much for your time and input today. In follow up to our conversation about
TrainDatasetforDialogActs:Same time on Monday or Tuesday work for you?
TrainDatasetforDialogActs:Have you got a few minutes to chat about our product?
TrainDatasetforDialogActs:Are you available for a brief 15 to 20 minute meeting next Tuesday or Thursday morning
TrainDatasetforDialogActs:to get the ball rolling
TrainDatasetforDialogActs:Get started with your free trial
TrainDatasetforDialogActs:Sign up now
TrainDatasetforDialogActs:I am on it!
SearchQueryLogsImplicitFeedback:Goal: Connect to Outlook,SharePoint and Google search - if user searches for a Topic-word --> higher score
SearchQueryLogsImplicitFeedback: Problem: It will not allow us to overcome the ProperNoun limitation.
SearchQueryLogsImplicitFeedback:: Intranet / Custom Search engine - How to determine which urls from browser history are considered ?
SearchQueryLogsImplicitFeedback: Classifier for search queries (based on query and results ...)
SearchQueryLogsImplicitFeedback:How to Collect the Search Logs
SearchQueryLogsImplicitFeedback:Enhance:Google: Use APIs similar to MyLastSearch (nirsoft) to extract browser cache + browser history to collect google / Bing / Others searches
SearchQueryLogsImplicitFeedback: Spellcheck: The final submitted query may have spelling mistakes (Ex: unsupervised traning), which Google 'did you mean' corrects on the fly.
PersonTopicsInvalidation: Ex: IBM Partnerworld (in sujb) --> wasn't recognized as a Topic IBM (even though I have IBM as Topic)
PersonTopicsInvalidation: Topic['IBM'].invalid = true.
PersonTopicsInvalidation: Problem: Fixes the 'IBM' invalidator, but doesn't fix mail From: 'Connections Cloud' --> Invalidates Connections topic
PersonTopicsInvalidation: Better detection of marketing emails contributes also to fixing other bugs.
PersonTopicsInvalidation: Use Databases of Person names from all the world (as opposed to Standford eng models)
isMarketingEmail: Build emailStats on corpus:
isMarketingEmail: cd Reports/tests/marketing
isMarketingEmail: Run automated test against myContacts_expected.json
isMarketingEmail:- - - -
isMarketingEmail: 'harmon.ie Support Request' emails, that are n
isMarketingEmail: David
isMarketingEmail: Tim is a real person, which really corresponds with davidl (.To and .Cc, all its from is isFocused=true)
isMarketingEmail: See D:\Backup\Collage\personSubstr.js + add matchNonPersonTokSubStr : 0 to filterInfo object init.
isMarketingEmail:
isMarketingEmail: Ex: Ijona Skills <webinar@ijonaskills.us>
isMarketingEmail: Ex: David Seymour <redmond@1105tech.com>
isMarketingEmail: Problem: Non-english displayName  זהר ברג <berg@zazim-bareshet.co.il>
isMarketingEmail: Individual marketing email detection using scoring of several strong features (without emailStats)
isMarketingEmail: Added reFilteAutomatedDiff to understand the diff
isMarketingEmail: Q: Does it overcome matching domainTok ?
isMarketingEmail: Types of Automated Emails
isMarketingEmail: Marketing
isMarketingEmail: Ex: Redmine plan.io notifications - Html body, .To = 0, Outside org
isMarketingEmail: Workflow (DocuSign)
isMarketingEmail: CRM Domain mapping: the email is from their domain (aon.com) , which we consider important
isMarketingEmail: Ex: 'Getting started with your harmon.ie VIP access' - sent from a real sales person Alyssa Franklin <alyssaf@harmon.ie>
isMarketingEmail: Manual with non-Person email address
isMarketingEmail: Ex: From: ITASSET.MANAGER@gd-ms.com, Subject: RE: GENERAL DYNAMICS MIS PO 51ESM1003408 Supplier: HARMON.IE CORP Body: All, Please confirm that deliverables ...
isMarketingEmail: Only startsWith or endsWith - avoid counting twice in case of exact match (but it should have been filtered out by matchDomainTok - full match)
isMarketingEmail: Microsoft <microsoft@email.microsoftemail.com>  - tok + [e]mail --> domainTok
isMarketingEmail: Dropbox <no-reply@dropboxmail.com> 			- tok + [e]mail --> domainTok
isMarketingEmail: Does from|marketing appears in displayName ?
isMarketingEmail: Does marketing appears in user part of emailAddress (substr) ?
isMarketingEmail: reply - suffix of a token
isMarketingEmail: email@mail.salesforce.com
isMarketingEmail: Do not substr 'mail' --> nbettach@gmail.com
isMarketingEmail: Subject - find more words
isMarketingEmail: We may need them to differentiate between marketing and machine-generated (plan.io) emails
isMarketingEmail: We can use it to disqualify a single email (ex: full of Html tags) --> a solution to the lowStats problem
isMarketingEmail: use mailUpdates --> but also add emailStats of mailUpdates  --> require inc. update of stat counters
isMarketingEmail: Common marketing words/links in body: unsubscribe/subscribe -
isMarketingEmail: Problem: Today, a sharepoint actor is created only if the user posted or received an SP update - meaning less active SP users will not have actors.
isMarketingEmail: Users do not send emails to marketing addresses and rarely send to automated systems
isMarketingEmail: Scan Sent Folder to detect non-Person emails
isMarketingEmail: Cloud based (Connections / IBM Workspace) - do contain the 'You can unsubscribe' text
isMarketingEmail: Problem: Zendesk Notification Emails are not repetitive - the main content is comments to the issue
isMarketingEmail: Good Technology
isMarketingEmail:To unsubscribe from future emails or to update your e-mail preferences, click here.
isMarketingEmail: Marketing Urls: content of urls (query params - utm_campaign, go.xxx links, )
isMarketingEmail: collect common substrings from many Captioned Urls
isMarketingEmail: Marketing (always), Automated (not always - Jenkins, VIP Access from ronj or richard ...)
isMarketingEmail: Marketing (always), Automated (not always - Jenkins ...)
isMarketingEmail: Org wide stat
isMarketingEmail: Note: The graybox at the bottom is generated by MS/Exchange and is NOT part of the original email body: Getting too much email from Watson Workspace <donotreply@workspace.ibm.com>? You can unsubscribe
isMarketingEmail: The original body still contains the word unsbscribe very often.
isMarketingEmail: Note: Citrix uses the mktg events company - so they send the emails for Citrix.
isMarketingEmail: Connections Cloud <no-reply@collabserv.com>
isMarketingEmail: Travel Document itinerary@amadeus.com
isMarketingEmail: The Progress Team <progresssoftware@businessmaking.progress.net>
isMarketingEmail: NetApp <mail@marketing.netapp.com>

isMarketingEmail: Tracy at European SharePoint, Office 365 & Azure Conference
isMarketingEmail: Number of Words at From: that are found in Wikipedia as non Person names
isMarketingEmail: IBM Watson Knowledge Studio
isMarketingEmail: Repetitive structure - See 'Duplicate
isMarketingEmail: Collect all emails from this sender From: Address in the Org -->
isMarketingEmail: Note: Even when it was false, OWA displayed the unsubscribe UI - which is probably based on a classifer other than this property.
isMarketingEmail:2)	Bug about Collage not mapping a domain for a specific email because it was marked as Marketing Email. We fixed this bug and perhaps this solution can be done on ‘regular’ topic extraction and not just for domain mapping.
isMarketingEmail: Note: isNotPersonalName - if not in your Outlook Contacts - it only means you didn't add them to Contacts, not it is an automated mail (mailboxType !== 'Contact' && mailboxType !== 'Mailbox')
isMarketingEmail: Write .test.js based on myContacts_trainset.json (same format as sigs data.json test)
isMarketingEmail: Connect to myContacts and compare isAutomated, isPerson to expected.
isMarketingEmail: join query with mailUpdates - display 3 emails from this contact
